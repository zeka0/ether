###Pre-note
- Docs can be found in `\doc`
- I am playing __Metal Gear Solid V__ now, it's really a good game.
- The files in the directory `\deprecated` are from older versions.

###Introduction:
- It's a __theano__-based neural-network.
- Required modulas include: __numpy__, __theano__.
- It's a little bit complicated to learn to use at first.

##Notes From Author:
- Neural network is really tough to learn.
- The key part in bulding a nnet is in __selecting proper parameters for layers__.
- And also, if time premitted, grabing a book about numpy is a really good choice.
- I used the `\clearPyc.py` to clean the pyc files created by python interpreter before pushing to git.

##Cautions
- It's strongly recommended to read the `doc` before using this project.
- If you have never touched __numpy__ or __theano__ before, I suggest you to try them out yourself a little bit.
It's because sometimes when you find a bug, having some knowledge of them can help great lot.
