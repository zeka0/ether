##Introduction:
-It's a __theano__-based neural-network.
-Required modulas include: __numpy__, __theano__.
-It's a little bit complicated to learn to use at first.

##Notes From Author:
-Neural network is really tough to learn.
-And also, if time premitted, grabing a book about numpy is a really good choice.
-__Yoshua Bengio__ is a pretty nice guy(But his books are not friendly at all).
-I used the `\test\clearPyc.py` to clean the pyc files created by python interpreter before pushing to git.
