##Introduction:
- It's a __theano__-based neural-network.
- Required modulas include: __numpy__, __theano__.
- It's a little bit complicated to learn to use at first.

###Notes From Author:
- Neural network is really tough to learn.
- The key part in bulding a nnet is in __selecting proper parameters for layers__.
- And also, if time premitted, grabing a book about numpy is a really good choice.
- I used the `\clearPyc.py` to clean the pyc files created by python interpreter before pushing to git.
